Project materials
-----------------

Hardware
^^^^^^^^

* Raspberry Pi Zero-W
* Micro-SD card
* A computer with an SD card slot or a USB micro-SD card adapter

.. note::
    For the following items, there are alternatives, but this is what this guide will cover.
    
    The important thing to note is that the Zero-w only has Micro-B USB ports and a Mini-HDMI output.
    
    You can also skip all of these materials by configuring wifi and ssh on the SD card after flashing the ISO, but before installing it in the Pi. Using that method you would then access the Pi remotely through SSH on your desktop or laptop. You would also need access to your router to obtain the Pi's IP address for the SSH connection. If you're up for it, `here's a link to instructions <https://peppe8o.com/install-raspberry-pi-os-lite-in-your-raspberry-pi/>`_.

* Male-to-male Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable
* Display with HDMI input
* Male Micro-B USB to Female A USB Adapter
* USB Keyboard

No mouse is required, because we aren't using a linux distribution with a desktop environment.

Installing the OS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this project, we will be using Raspbian Pi OS Lite. To install the OS on the Pi, use the `official guide <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/>`_.
